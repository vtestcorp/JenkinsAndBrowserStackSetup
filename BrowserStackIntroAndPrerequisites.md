# BrowserStack-Introduction and Prerequisites 

## Introduction

Jenkins is an open-source Continuous Integration (CI) server, which automates the build and deploy process of your web applications. By running your Selenium test suite in Jenkins, you also automate testing as part of the build process. Add BrowserStack to the mix, and your web apps can be tested across 3000+ real devices and desktop browsers. BrowserStack lets you integrate your Selenium tests with Jenkins using a plugin that connects your Jenkins CI server to the BrowserStack Selenium Grid.

Use the BrowserStack Jenkins plugin to:

	Configure your BrowserStack credentials for your Jenkins jobs.
 
	Set up and tear down the BrowserStack Local binary for testing internal, development, and staging environments.
 
	Embed BrowserStack test results, including video, logs, and screenshots in your Jenkins job results.


## Prerequisites

You need the following set up before you begin:

●	An existing Jenkins CI server (version 1.653+)
●	A BrowserStack account
